This is the unit test runner sample program.

It uses embUnit as the xUnit framework and its internal tests as the tests to
run.

Building instructions:
1. First build the embUnit static library for the target (*):
	make CC=$PATH_TO_TOOLCHAIN/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc \
		AR=$PATH_TO_TOOLCHAIN/bin/arm-none-eabi-ar \
		LIBS="-lc -lnosys" CFLAGS="-mthumb -mcpu=cortex-m3 -specs=nano.specs -DNO_STDIO_PRINTF"
		
2. After that build and link the firmware with the above:
	make BUILD_DIR=/tmp/build/

(*) That gonna work with my patch found at: https://github.com/ildar/embunit
