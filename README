This is the unit test runner sample program.

It uses CGreen (not embUnit now)) as the xUnit framework and its sample tests
as the test to run.

Building instructions:
1. First build the CGreen static library for the target (*):
	cmake -DSTM32_CHIP=stm32f103c8 \
	-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/stm32-cmake/cmake/gcc_stm32.cmake \
	-DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH=/path/to/stm32-cmake/cmake \
	-DTOOLCHAIN_PREFIX=/path/to/arm_gcc_with_newlib \
	/path/to/cgreen/ && make

	That wont build all of CGreen but libcgreen.a is enough.
2. After that build and link the firmware with the above libcgreen:
	cmake && make

(*) That gonna work with my port of CGreen found at:
	https://github.com/ildar/cgreen/tree/embedded
